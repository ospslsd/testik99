        <h2>
          Procedure for performing non-trading operations
        </h2>
        <p class="mb-40">

          2.1 Non-trading operations include operations of replenishment of the Client's trading account and withdrawal
          of funds
          (deposit and withdrawal of funds). All such operations are final (without the possibility of recall) after
          their full
          processing and crediting.
          <br><br>
          2.2 Non-trading operations are performed by the Client using the functionality of the Client's Account. The
          Company does
          not perform non-trading operations using conventional means of communication.
          <br><br>
          2.3. When performing non-trading operations, the Client is allowed to use only personal funds located in
          electronic and
          bank payment accounts belonging to the Client.
          <br><br>
          2.4 The currency of the trading account is the US Dollar. The balance of funds in the Client's trading account
          is
          displayed in this currency. The currency of the trading account cannot be changed. When the Client deposits
          funds into
          his trading account, the deposit amount is automatically recalculated from the currency used by the Client to
          the
          currency of the trading account. The same operation occurs when processing the withdrawal of funds.
          <br><br>
          2.5. The Company, if there is a need to recalculate funds from one currency to another, uses the conversion
          rate of the
          electronic payment system at the time of the non-trading transaction.
          <br><br>
          2.6 The Company sets the following minimum amounts (unless otherwise specified) for non-trading transactions:
          -
          replenishment of the trading account - 10 USD; - withdrawal from the trading account - 50 USD.
          <br><br>
          2.7 If the Client uses different wallets to replenish the trading account, the withdrawal of funds to them is
          carried
          out in the same proportion in which the replenishment took place. In this case, the amount of trading profit
          can be
          divided in half between different wallets. If the Company is unable to ensure the withdrawal of funds to the
          details
          specified by the Client, the Company is obliged to notify the Client about this in order to change the
          selected payment
          systems or wallets.
          <br><br>
          2.8 If the Client uses bank cards to replenish the trading account, the Client agrees that the Company can
          save the
          payment details of the bank card in order to implement the "quick replenishment" function of the trading
          account in one
          click, when the Client uses the corresponding functionality in the Client's Cabinet. The Client can disable
          this service
          upon request by contacting the Company's support service.
          <br><br>
          2.9 At the request of the Company, the Client undertakes to
          provide confirming scans / photographs of the cards used to replenish the Trading Account, for verification
          purposes,
          and also excludes the possibility of any claims against the Company regarding the deposited funds.
          <br><br>
          2.10 In order to ensure compliance with the requirements of generally accepted legislative norms, as well as
          to protect
          the funds of the Clients, the withdrawal of funds is carried out in the same payment system in which they were
          deposited, using the same payment details.
          <br><br>
          2.11 The Company does not allow the service it provides to be used as a means of making a profit from
          non-trading
          operations, or in a way other than the direct use of the service it provides.

          participation of the Company's personnel. In exceptional cases, if there are failures in the software of
          intermediaries

          Article 6. Trading
        </h2>
        <p class="mb-40">

          6.1. No refunds: Placing Orders and making Trades is at your own risk. Any Trade you make, whether on purpose
          or by
          mistake, is final and cannot be reversed. No refund of any Trade shall take place.
          <br><br>
          6.2. Reversing/adjusting Trades: We reserve the right to reverse a Trade or adjust the price of a Trade that
          we regard
          as being abnormal in respect of the price level to be expected from an orderly market, without being liable
          for any
          damages resulting from such reversal or adjustment.
          <br><br>
          6.3. Trading pause: We reserve the right to halt or limit the possibility to place Orders or make Trades on
          the
          Platform, without being liable for any damages resulting from halting or limiting trading.
          <br><br>
          6.4. Trading restriction: We reserve the right to (i) limit your right to place Orders; (ii) cancel Orders;
          and/or (iii)
          partially or entirely close any or all of your Positions. The latter includes, but is not limited to, a
          Position that is
          profitable and/or a Position that does not breach any margin requirements. We can do this -without limitation-
          in order
          to reduce or close counterparty Position(s) that have breached the margin requirements. We are not liable for
          any
          damages that you might incur due to such measures. In the event we close any Position of you on basis of this
          clause, we
          can determine the price you will receive for the Product of which the Position is closed at our sole
          discretion, but in
          principle, this will be the Mark Price.
          <br><br>
          6.5. Forced deleveraging: Under extreme market circumstances, in order to protect the integrity of Onolytrade
          and the
          Platform, we reserve the right to partially or entirely close your Position(s) to be able to close positions
          of
          counterparties to help prevent counterparty bankruptcies, where the liquidity in the market is not enough to
          take over
          positions of counterparties that are on the verge of bankruptcy or already bankrupted. (Bankruptcy is defined
          in 6.7
          below). In the event we close any Position on basis of this clause, we can determine the price you will
          receive for the
          Product of which the Position is closed at our sole discretion, but in principle this will be the Mark Price.
          In case of
          liquidation on basis of this clause 6.5, whether or not any compensation from the Insurance Fund will be
          provided will
          be determined by us at our sole discretion.
          <br><br>
          6.6. Liquidation: If your available funds are insufficient for your Position(s), then your Position(s) will be
          incrementally closed against the then-available prices in the market until your funds are sufficient for the
          remainder
          of your Positions, in accordance with the applicable terms and policies for the relevant Product.
          <br><br>
          6.7. Bankruptcy: If your Positions have been liquidated and the amount of Cryptocurrency in your Wallet is
          insufficient
          to cover your (additional) losses, your Account is bankrupt. We will reset the balance of the relevant
          Cryptocurrency in
          your Account to zero by transferring funds from the Insurance Fund to your account.
          <br><br>
          6.8. Insurance Fund: The fund that will be used to cover for losses of bankruptcies. The balance of the
          Insurance Fund
          and terms that apply are available on our Website. If bankruptcies in a session deplete the Insurance Fund,
          any further
          losses will be covered by profits made by traders on the Platform on a pro-rata basis. In such a case, all
          winning
          traders of a session would get taxed a percentage on their profits to cover for the bankruptcies of other
          Accounts.
